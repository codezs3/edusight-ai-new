  teachers: User[] @relation("SchoolStaff")
  students: Student[]
  parents: Parent[]
}

// User Base Entity
User {
  id: String @id
  role: UserRole // ADMIN, SCHOOL_ADMIN, TEACHER, PARENT, STUDENT
  accountType: AccountType // B2C, B2B
  schoolId: String? // NULL for B2C users
  school: School?
}

// Parent-Child Relationships
Parent {
  id: String @id
  userId: String @unique
  user: User @relation(fields: [userId])
  children: Student[] // One-to-many relationship
  schoolId: String? // NULL for B2C parents
  school: School?
}

Student {
  id: String @id
  userId: String @unique
  user: User @relation(fields: [userId])
  parentId: String?
  parent: Parent? @relation(fields: [parentId])
  schoolId: String
  school: School @relation(fields: [schoolId])
}
```

#### **Access Control Implementation**
```typescript
// Middleware Example: School Admin Student Access
async function validateSchoolAdminAccess(userId: string, studentId: string) {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
    include: { school: true }
  });
  
  const student = await prisma.student.findUnique({
    where: { id: studentId },
    include: { school: true }
  });
  
  // Ensure school admin can only access students from their school
  if (user?.schoolId !== student?.schoolId) {
    throw new UnauthorizedError('Access denied: Student not in your school');
  }
}

// Parent Child Access Validation
async function validateParentChildAccess(parentId: string, childId: string) {
  const child = await prisma.student.findUnique({
    where: { id: childId },
    select: { parentId: true }
  });
  
  if (child?.parentId !== parentId) {
    throw new UnauthorizedError('Access denied: Not your child');
  }
}
```
