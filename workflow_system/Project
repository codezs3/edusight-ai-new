📊 Mathematical & Statistical Models Behind Edusight
🎓 1. Academic Analytics Engine
Method	Formula	Purpose
Growth Rate	$$GR = \frac{S_t - S_{t-1}}{S_{t-1}} \times 100$$	Measures academic improvement term-over-term
Z-Score Normalization	$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$	Standardizes scores for cross-grade comparison
Standard Deviation	$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}(X_i - \mu)^2}$$	Tracks dispersion in student performance
Linear Regression	$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$$	Models score trends across time or subjects
Percentile Scoring	$$P = \frac{\text{Rank of student}}{\text{Total students}} \times 100$$	Assigns relative standing within cohort
🔧 Use Case: Predictive tracking for grade slippage, academic anomaly detection, normalization across school branches.
🏃‍♂️ 2. Physical Fitness Evaluation
Metric	Formula	Description
BMI	$$BMI = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}$$	Flags obesity or undernourishment
PACER Percentile	Referenced from FITNESSGRAM® tables	Benchmarked per age/gender
Trend Analysis	Custom moving average per term	Detects long-term health shifts
⚠️ Red Flags: Underweight students with declining PACER score may trigger health alerts or counseling recommendations.
🧠 3. Psychological & Behavioral Analytics
Indicator	Formula	Application
Cronbach's Alpha	$$\alpha = \frac{N}{N - 1} \left(1 - \frac{\sum \sigma_i^2}{\sigma_{\text{total}}^2} \right)$$	Assesses psychometric test reliability
GAD-7 Anxiety Threshold	Score ≥ 10	Flags moderate/severe anxiety
Standard Score Mapping	$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$ (reused)	Aligns scores to behavioral thresholds
🔄 Integration: Mental health scores flow into counseling workflows and school-wide intervention dashboards.
🎯 4. Career Recommendation AI Engine
Model	Technique	Role
Cosine Similarity	$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{S \cdot C}{|S| |C|}$$	Measures fit between student profile and career vector
Feature Vectorization	TF-IDF or weighted traits encoding	Converts interests, scores, traits to numeric space
Ranking & Explanation	Sorted by similarity score + rationale	Output career options with contextual fit
🧠 Add-on Option: You can extend to Embeddings using models like BERT or Sentence Transformers for richer career descriptions.
🔍 5. Additional Statistical Methods
Area	Method	Use Case
SWOT Analysis	Quantified via Likert-scale & external policy feeds	Personal development planning
Cluster Analysis	K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering	Identifies risk or talent pockets across campuses
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)	$$X = WZ$$	Dimensionality reduction for psychometric data
Anomaly Detection	Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM	Detects outliers in academic/emotional behavior
🛡️ Security Layer: Role-based access to psychological flags and anomaly scores protects student confidentiality.
🤖 AI Models in Deployment
Component	Model Type	Role
Career Matching	Vector similarity (Cosine), optional ML classifier	Maps student to best-fit careers
Anomaly Detection	Unsupervised (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders)	Flags academic or emotional risks
Recommendation System	Hybrid (Content-based + Rule-based)	Pushes interventions and content to stakeholders
Analytics Engine	Statistical + ML pipelines	Renders school-level dashboards, cohort flags
📌 Scalability Note: You can modularize these into microservices (e.g., /career-match, /risk-score) for easier deployment and scaling.
